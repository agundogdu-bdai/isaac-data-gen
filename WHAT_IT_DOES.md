# What It Does - Technical Deep Dive

This document explains how the Isaac Data Gen system works, the design decisions, and implementation details.

---

## System Overview

Isaac Data Gen is a data collection pipeline for robot manipulation tasks using Isaac Lab. It:

1. **Spawns parallel robot environments** with wide spacing for clear visualization
2. **Runs a trained RL policy** to generate diverse trajectories
3. **Captures dual camera streams** (overview + wrist-mounted) synchronized per timestep
4. **Saves VPL-format datasets** with MP4 videos and HDF5 files

## Episode Model

### Vectorized Environments = Multiple Episodes

**Important**: With vectorized environments, each parallel environment is a **separate episode**.

```
--num_envs 20 --num_episodes 2

Round 1: env.reset() → 20 different initial states → 20 episodes
Round 2: env.reset() → 20 different initial states → 20 episodes

Total: 40 unique episodes
```

Each `env.reset()` randomizes:
- Robot joint positions
- Cabinet/drawer positions
- Object placements (if any)
- Initial velocities

This ensures diversity in the dataset without manual intervention.

---

## Camera System

### Triple Camera Setup

**Camera 0 (Overview/Tiled Camera):**
- **Purpose**: Side-angle view of entire workspace
- **Prim Path**: `{ENV_REGEX_NS}/tiled_camera` (one per env)
- **Position**: Offset from env origin (default: `[-2.0, 0.5, 2.1]`)
- **Fixed**: Doesn't move during episode
- **Use Case**: Context, spatial awareness, overall task progress

**Camera 1 (Wrist Camera):**
- **Purpose**: First-person view from gripper
- **Prim Path**: `{ENV_REGEX_NS}/wrist_camera` (one per env)
- **Position**: Follows end-effector pose every step
- **Dynamic**: Updates with robot motion
- **Use Case**: Fine-grained manipulation, object grasp details

**Camera 2 (Top Camera):**
- **Purpose**: Top-down bird's-eye view
- **Prim Path**: `{ENV_REGEX_NS}/top_camera` (one per env)
- **Position**: Static, directly above environment (default: `[0.0, 0.0, 3.0]`)
- **Fixed**: Doesn't move during episode
- **Use Case**: Overhead perspective, spatial relationships, trajectory planning

### Why Three Cameras?

Vision-based policies benefit from multiple viewpoints:
- **Overview camera**: Side-angle context (where is the robot relative to the drawer?)
- **Wrist camera**: Manipulation details (is the gripper aligned with the handle?)
- **Top camera**: Overhead planning view (robot's trajectory and spatial layout)

Combined, they provide comprehensive visual coverage for robust policy learning.

---

## Top Camera Implementation

### Static Positioning

The top camera is positioned once at initialization:

```
Position: [0.0, 0.0, 3.0] from environment origin
  - Directly above the workspace
  - 3 meters high (adjustable)
  
Target: [0.4, 0.0, 0.5] from environment origin
  - Looking at task workspace center
  - Where robot-cabinet interaction happens
```

**Configuration**:
- Set via `--top_cam_offset` and `--top_tgt_offset`
- Position is in **world/environment frame**, not robot frame
- Static throughout episode (no dynamic updates needed)
- Provides consistent overhead view for all timesteps

**Use Cases**:
- Spatial planning and trajectory understanding
- Top-down object relationships
- Complementary to side and wrist views
- Useful for tasks requiring bird's-eye context

---

## Wrist Camera Implementation

### Coordinate Frames

The wrist camera uses **end-effector relative positioning**:

```
End-Effector Frame (for Franka Panda):
  X-axis: Forward (direction fingers point)
  Y-axis: Side (perpendicular to fingers)
  Z-axis: Up (normal to gripper palm)
```

Default offsets:
- **Camera position**: `[-0.05, 0.0, 0.08]` 
  - 5cm behind gripper center
  - 8cm above gripper (on wrist)
  - Avoids clipping with robot body
  
- **Look-at target**: `[0.25, 0.0, 0.0]`
  - 25cm forward along gripper axis
  - Looking straight ahead where gripper will reach

### Pose Computation

Every timestep:
1. **Get EE pose** from robot articulation: `body_pos_w[:, -1, :]`, `body_quat_w[:, -1, :]`
2. **Convert quaternion to rotation matrix** (batch operation)
3. **Transform offsets** from EE frame to world frame using rotation matrix
4. **Set camera pose** via `set_world_poses_from_view(positions, targets)`
5. **Update camera** to render from new viewpoint

This ensures the wrist camera always follows the gripper naturally.

---

## Data Format

### Why Unified HDF5?

Instead of separate files per camera, we use a **unified multi-camera format**:

```python
# Single color dataset with camera dimension
color.shape = (T, N_cams, H, W, 3)

# Example with triple cameras:
color.shape = (60, 3, 320, 240, 3)
#              T   cams H    W   RGB
```

**Benefits**:
- Single file per episode (easier to manage)
- Natural indexing: `color[:, 0]` = overview, `color[:, 1]` = wrist, `color[:, 2]` = top
- Standard format for multi-view datasets
- Intrinsics and extrinsics also concatenated along camera dimension
- Flexible: N_cams = 1, 2, or 3 depending on flags

### MP4 Videos

Separate MP4 files are still saved for easy viewing:
- `camera_0/episode_XXX.mp4` - Overview camera
- `camera_1/episode_XXX.mp4` - Wrist camera (if enabled)
- `camera_2/episode_XXX.mp4` - Top camera (if enabled)

These are redundant with HDF5 but useful for quick inspection.

---

## Memory Optimization

### No Intermediate PNGs

Traditional approach:
```
Capture → Save PNG → Load PNGs → Encode MP4 → Delete PNGs
```

Our approach:
```
Capture → Store in RAM → Encode MP4 directly
```

**Savings**: ~60% less disk I/O, no temporary files

### Frame Sampling

Use `--video_interval 2` to store every 2nd frame:
- Reduces storage by 50%
- Playback FPS auto-adjusted to maintain real-time speed
- Example: 30 FPS capture, interval=2 → 15 FPS playback

---

## Scene Configuration

### Manager-Based vs Direct-Attribute

Isaac Lab supports two scene configuration styles:

**Manager-Based** (newer environments):
```python
env_cfg.scene.sensors = {
    'tiled_camera': TiledCameraCfg(...),
    'wrist_camera': TiledCameraCfg(...),
}
```

**Direct-Attribute** (older environments):
```python
env_cfg.scene.tiled_camera = TiledCameraCfg(...)
env_cfg.scene.wrist_camera = TiledCameraCfg(...)
```

Our code **automatically detects and handles both**:
```python
if hasattr(env_cfg.scene, 'sensors') and env_cfg.scene.sensors is not None:
    env_cfg.scene.sensors['wrist_camera'] = wrist_cam_cfg
else:
    env_cfg.scene.wrist_camera = wrist_cam_cfg
```

---

## Robot State Collection

### Direct Articulation Access

We collect robot states directly from the articulation data:

```python
robot_articulation = env.unwrapped.scene._articulations.get("robot")

# Joint states
joint_pos = robot_articulation.data.joint_pos[env_idx]
joint_vel = robot_articulation.data.joint_vel[env_idx]

# End-effector pose (last body)
ee_pos = robot_articulation.data.body_pos_w[env_idx, -1, :]
ee_rot = robot_articulation.data.body_quat_w[env_idx, -1, :]
```

**Why direct access?**
- Clean, simple code
- No fallback mechanisms needed
- Guaranteed availability in articulation-based tasks
- Lower overhead than observation manager queries

---

## Policy Inference

### Checkpoint Loading

Supports multiple checkpoint formats:
```python
checkpoint = torch.load(path)

# Format 1: Full training state
if 'model_state_dict' in checkpoint:
    model_state = checkpoint['model_state_dict']

# Format 2: Just state dict
elif 'state_dict' in checkpoint:
    model_state = checkpoint['state_dict']

# Format 3: Direct state dict
else:
    model_state = checkpoint
```

### Observation Handling

Handles both dict and flat observations:
```python
if isinstance(obs, dict):
    obs_tensor = torch.cat([v.view(v.shape[0], -1) for v in obs.values()], dim=-1)
else:
    obs_tensor = obs

actions = policy.act_inference(obs_tensor)
```

---

## VPL Dataset Writer

### Store-Write Pattern

**Store**: Accumulate data in memory during rollout
```python
for t in range(steps):
    actions = policy.act_inference(obs)
    obs, rewards, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(actions)
    saver.store(actions=actions, env=env, store_frame=True)
```

**Write**: Write to disk when episode completes
```python
saver.write(dones=dones, terminated=terminated, successes=successes, save_to_video=True)
```

### Per-Environment Episodes

Each environment gets its own episode directory:
```
episode_000 ← from env_idx=0, round=1
episode_001 ← from env_idx=1, round=1
...
episode_019 ← from env_idx=19, round=1
episode_020 ← from env_idx=0, round=2
...
```

This allows:
- Independent success tracking per environment
- Different trajectory lengths if needed
- Clear episode boundaries in dataset

---

## Quaternion Math

### Why Quaternion to Rotation Matrix?

To transform camera offsets from end-effector frame to world frame:

```python
# Camera offset in EE frame
offset_ee = [-0.05, 0.0, 0.08]

# Transform to world frame
R = quat_to_rotation_matrix(ee_quat)
offset_world = R @ offset_ee
camera_pos_world = ee_pos + offset_world
```

### Implementation Details

Uses standard quaternion-to-rotation formula with XYZW ordering:
```python
R[0,0] = 1 - 2*(yy + zz)
R[0,1] = 2*(xy - wz)
R[0,2] = 2*(xz + wy)
# ... etc
```

Normalized before conversion to handle numerical errors.

Vectorized for batch processing (all environments simultaneously).

---

## Docker Setup

### Base Image

Uses `nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-lab:2.2.0` which includes:
- Isaac Sim 4.5+
- Isaac Lab 2.2.0
- Pre-configured Isaac Lab tasks
- GPU-accelerated physics and rendering

### Additions

Our Dockerfile adds:
- Ray 2.31.0 (for future distributed training)
- Python/pip shims for convenience
- Proper EULA acceptance for headless mode

### Volume Mounting

```bash
-v $(pwd):$(pwd)
```

Mounts workspace bidirectionally:
- Copy scripts from host → container
- Copy datasets from container → host
- No need to rebuild for script changes

---

## Headless Rendering

### Environment Variables

```bash
ENABLE_CAMERAS=1           # Enable Isaac Lab camera system
ISAAC_SIM_HEADLESS=1       # Run without GUI
CARB_WINDOWING_USE_EGL=1   # Use EGL for GPU rendering (no X11)
```

**Why EGL?**
- Works on remote servers without display
- GPU-accelerated rendering
- Required for camera sensor output in headless mode

---

## Performance Considerations

### Environment Count vs GPU Memory

| Num Envs | GPU Memory | Use Case |
|----------|------------|----------|
| 10 | ~8GB | Testing, debugging |
| 20 | ~12GB | Standard collection |
| 40 | ~20GB | Large-scale datasets |
| 100+ | ~24GB+ | Production training data |

### Resolution Impact

| Resolution | Per-Env Memory | Use Case |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| 256×192 | ~0.4GB | Fast prototyping |
| 320×240 | ~0.6GB | Standard collection |
| 640×480 | ~1.2GB | High-quality datasets |
| 1280×720 | ~2.5GB | Publication-quality |

---

## Design Decisions

### Why MP4 Only?

**Alternatives considered:**
- PNG sequence: High quality but slow I/O
- Numpy arrays: Fast but huge file sizes
- H264/H265 in HDF5: Complex encoding

**MP4 chosen because:**
- Good compression (~50MB per 60-frame episode)
- Standard format (easy to view)
- Fast encoding with imageio+ffmpeg
- Widely supported

### Why AppLauncher First?

```python
# Must be done this way:
from isaaclab.app import AppLauncher
app = AppLauncher(args).app
# Now import other Isaac Lab modules
import isaaclab.sensors
```

**Reason**: AppLauncher initializes Omniverse Kit before other modules. Importing sensors before app launch causes `omni.physics` import errors.

### Why TiledCamera Not Regular Camera?

**TiledCamera**: Single sensor capturing all environments
- One `update()` call per timestep
- Vectorized GPU rendering
- Output shape: `(num_envs, H, W, 3)`

**Regular Camera**: Separate sensor per environment  
- `num_envs` update calls
- Individual rendering pipelines
- Slower for many environments

For 20+ environments, TiledCamera is significantly faster.

---

## Implementation Choices

### No Success Filtering

```python
episode_success = np.ones(num_envs, dtype=bool)  # All marked successful
```

**Why?**
- Preserves all collected data
- Allows post-hoc filtering
- Useful for studying failure modes
- User can filter during training if desired

### Direct Robot Access

```python
robot_articulation = env.unwrapped.scene._articulations.get("robot")
```

**Why not observation manager?**
- Direct access is faster
- Avoids observation processing overhead
- Guaranteed to have full robot state
- No missing fields from partial observations

### Simplified Code (No Fallbacks)

Original code had multiple fallback mechanisms. Removed because:
- Makes code harder to understand
- Hides actual issues instead of fixing them
- Isaac Lab environments are consistent enough to not need fallbacks
- Better to fail fast and fix the root cause

---

## Camera Positioning Strategy

### Overview Camera

Fixed relative to environment origin:
```python
position = env_origin + [-2.0, 0.5, 2.1]  # Behind, side, above
target = env_origin + [0.4, 0.0, 0.5]      # Look at workspace center
```

Chosen to:
- Show entire robot + cabinet + workspace
- Avoid occlusion from robot arm
- Capture manipulation from clear angle

### Wrist Camera

Dynamic, follows end-effector:
```python
# In end-effector frame
camera_offset = [-0.05, 0.0, 0.08]  # Behind and above gripper
look_offset = [0.25, 0.0, 0.0]       # Look 25cm forward

# Transform to world
R = quaternion_to_rotation_matrix(ee_quat)
camera_pos_world = ee_pos + R @ camera_offset
target_pos_world = ee_pos + R @ look_offset
```

Positioning rationale:
- **Behind gripper**: Avoids clipping with fingers/objects
- **Above gripper**: Reduces occlusion from hand
- **Look forward**: Sees where gripper is reaching
- **In EE frame**: Natural motion that follows manipulation intent

---

## Data Collection Loop

### High-Level Flow

```python
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    obs = env.reset()  # Randomize initial states
    
    for step in range(max_steps):
        # Policy inference
        actions = policy.act_inference(obs)
        
        # Step simulation
        obs, rewards, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(actions)
        
        # Store data (all envs in parallel)
        saver.store(actions=actions, env=env, store_frame=True)
    
    # Write complete episodes to disk
    saver.write(dones=all_done, successes=all_success, save_to_video=True)
```

### Store Method Details

For each timestep and each environment:

1. **Update cameras**: 
   - Overview camera: already positioned
   - Wrist camera: compute pose from EE, update position

2. **Capture frames**:
   - `rgb = camera.data.output["rgb"][env_idx]`
   - Convert CHW→HWC if needed
   - Convert float→uint8 if needed
   - Append to episode buffer

3. **Store actions/proprio**:
   - Actions from policy
   - Observations from observation manager
   - Joint states from articulation
   - EE pose from articulation

4. **Increment timestep**

### Write Method Details

When episode completes:

1. **Create episode directory**: `episode_{counter:03d}/`

2. **Encode MP4s**:
   - `imageio.imwrite(path, frames_list, fps=30)`
   - One MP4 per camera stream

3. **Write HDF5**:
   - Stack frames: `(T, H, W, C)` → `(T, 1, H, W, C)`
   - Concatenate cameras: `(T, 2, H, W, C)` if wrist enabled
   - Save all data: action, proprio, color, intrinsics, etc.

4. **Clear buffers**: Reset episode data for next round

5. **Increment counter**: Each env gets unique episode number

---

## Environment Spacing

### Why 5-6 Meters?

```python
env_cfg.scene.env_spacing = 6.0  # meters
```

**Standard Isaac Lab default**: 2-3 meters (robots can interfere)

**Our choice**: 5-6 meters
- Clear visual separation in overview camera
- No risk of collision between environments
- Easier to identify which robot is which
- Better for debugging and visualization

**Trade-off**: Larger spacing = larger scene = more GPU memory

---

## Video FPS and Frame Sampling

### Effective FPS Calculation

```python
effective_fps = fps / video_interval

# Example:
fps = 30
video_interval = 2
effective_fps = 15  # Playback at 15 FPS to maintain real-time speed
```

**Why?**
- If we sample every 2nd frame but play at 30 FPS, video runs 2x speed
- Adjusting playback FPS keeps video at real-time speed
- User sees actual task duration

---

## Error Handling Philosophy

### Fail Fast, No Silent Failures

```python
# Direct access - fails immediately if wrong
robot_articulation = env.unwrapped.scene._articulations.get("robot")
ee_pos = robot_articulation.data.body_pos_w[:, -1, :]
```

**Why this is better than try-except:**
- Immediate feedback when something is wrong
- Easier to debug
- Forces correct usage
- No hidden state corruption

### When We Do Handle Errors

Only for truly optional features:
```python
extrinsic_all = getattr(cam.data, "extrinsic_matrices", None)
```

Because `extrinsic_matrices` may not exist on all camera types, but it's not critical for data collection.

---

## Workflow Orchestration

### run_collection.sh Design

Four clear steps:
1. **Clean**: Remove old data to avoid mixing runs
2. **Copy**: Transfer scripts to container (allows local editing)
3. **Run**: Execute collection with all flags
4. **Retrieve**: Copy dataset back to host

**Why bash script?**
- Easy to modify parameters
- Version-controllable
- Can run from anywhere
- Clear audit trail of exact commands run

---

## Extensibility

### Adding More Cameras

The system already supports three cameras. To add a fourth camera (e.g., side view):

1. Add to scene config in `collect_tiled_with_checkpoint.py`:
```python
env_cfg.scene.side_camera = TiledCameraCfg(...)
```

2. Get reference in `vpl_saver.py`:
```python
side_cam = scene.sensors.get('side_camera')
```

3. Update and capture in `store()`:
```python
side_cam.update(dt=scene.physics_dt)
side_rgb = side_cam.data.output["rgb"]
```

4. Concatenate in HDF5 in `write()`:
```python
frames = np.concatenate([frames_cam0, frames_cam1, frames_cam2, frames_cam3], axis=1)
# Shape: (T, 4, H, W, C)
```

5. Add MP4 saving for `camera_3/` directory

### Supporting Other Tasks

The code works with any Isaac Lab task that has:
- Robot articulation named "robot"
- Standard observation manager
- Action space

Simply change `--task` parameter:
```bash
--task Isaac-Lift-Cube-Franka-v0
--task Isaac-Reach-Franka-v0
--task Isaac-Stack-Cube-Allegro-v0
```

---

## Performance Tips

### GPU Memory Management

If running out of memory:
1. Reduce `--num_envs`
2. Reduce resolution (`--width`, `--height`)
3. Increase `--video_interval` (save fewer frames)
4. Restart container: `docker restart isaaclab-test`

### Optimal Batch Sizes

For L4 GPU (24GB):
- 15-20 envs with dual cameras at 320×240
- 30-40 envs with single camera at 320×240
- 10-15 envs with dual cameras at 640×480

### Rendering Performance

TiledCamera rendering scales linearly:
- 10 envs: ~20ms per update
- 20 envs: ~40ms per update
- 40 envs: ~80ms per update

Physics simulation usually dominates (16ms per step at 60Hz).

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Grey/Black Frames

**Cause**: Camera not positioned correctly or clipping planes wrong

**Solution**:
- Check camera offsets are reasonable
- Verify clipping range includes scene objects
- Ensure camera pose is updated before capture

### Tensor Dimension Mismatches

**Cause**: Batch size mismatch in matrix operations

**Solution**:
- Use `unsqueeze(0).expand(num_envs, -1)` for offsets
- Always check tensor shapes before bmm operations
- Handle 1D tensors: `if tensor.ndim == 1: tensor = tensor.unsqueeze(0)`

### Import Order Errors

**Cause**: Importing Isaac Lab modules before AppLauncher

**Solution**:
```python
from isaaclab.app import AppLauncher  # First
app = AppLauncher(args).app           # Launch
# Now import everything else
import isaaclab.sensors
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions

1. **Depth cameras**: Add `"depth"` to `data_types`
2. **Segmentation**: Add semantic/instance segmentation
3. **Point clouds**: Generate from depth + intrinsics
4. **Language annotations**: Add task descriptions to metadata
5. **Proprioceptive history**: Stack last N observations
6. **Action chunking**: Record action sequences

### Scalability

For production datasets:
- Use Ray for distributed collection across multiple GPUs
- Stream to cloud storage instead of local disk
- Parallelize HDF5 writing
- Use lossless video encoding for archival
